# microservices_env
This runs various microservice applications so that one can extract traces.
To get traces in Google Storage, you need to both set up a job to extract from Pub/Sub to the storage, and download the pubsub service account key as service_account.json.  DO NOT PUSH THAT KEY TO GITHUB.
